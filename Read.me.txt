Smart Culinary Calorie Predictor:

                     🍳An Artificial Intelligence based system designed to predict food calories based on macronutrients and cooking methods1111. This project utilizes classical Machine Learning algorithms to provide a lightweight and fast solution for nutritional tracking22222.

🚀 Overview:
           The Smart Culinary Calorie Predictor bridges the gap between complex nutritional data and user-friendly dietary management3. Unlike heavy Deep Learning models, this tool is designed to run efficiently on low-resource devices while maintaining high accuracy444444444.

Key Features: 
             Accurate Prediction: Predicts caloric content using advanced regression algorithms5.
Caloric Density Classification: Categorizes food into Low, Medium, and High calorie classes666666666.+2User-Friendly GUI: Interactive interface for real-time interaction and instant results777777777.+2Cooking Method Integration: Adjusts calorie predictions based on the selected cooking method (e.g., Steam, Boil, Fry)888888888.+
